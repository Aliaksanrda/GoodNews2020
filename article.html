      <h1>Louisiana hospital nurses stayed behind during Hurricane Laura to care for 19 babies</h1>
        <p>
          Verified NICU staff at Lake Charles Memorial Hospital worked through Category 4 storm that damaged the hospital despite some potentially having damage to their own homes and a mandatory evacuation order. Over a dozen nurses and respiratory specialists are being hailed as heroes for protecting the babies through the storm.
Through extreme winds and water leakages, Lake Charles Memorial Hospital, which was being powered entirely by emergency generators, managed to keep all 19 of its NICU babies safe during the Category 4 storm.
Residents of Lake Charles were warned of the storm’s severity with a mandatory evacuation order.

The city was one of the hardest hit by Hurricane Laura, with an hour of 120-135 mph wind gusts as the eyewall crossed, according to the National Weather Service.

Dr. Bossano and a team of 14 nurses, 2 neonatal nurse practitioners, and 3 respiratory therapists stayed in the NICU all night. They split into two teams and took shifts, one team caring for the angelic newborns while the other tried to sleep as best they could.

Even with this system in place, the staff had their work cut out for them.
Some of the babies were on respirators and ventilators, and some were as small as one or two pounds. There were premature babies, born at just 23 weeks.

There was no air conditioning and in the middle of the night, the water went out in the hospital.

While NICU staff was sheltered with their tiny patients, Dr. Bossano posted an update about the babies on his Facebook page, hoping to ease parents’ panic over the safety of their little ones.
The babies were doing “better than all of us,” he wrote.

The newborns had already experienced quite an adventure, even before the hurricane blew through. Earlier that day, impending floods forced the NICU to evacuate from Lake Charles Memorial Hospital for Women to the main hospital.

“In two hours’ time, we transferred 19 NICU babies from that facility to our main campus,” said Matt Felder, director of communications for Lake Charles Memorial Health System.

“They did it in record time, 19 babies across the city in under two hours,” he said. And they were working on a deadline—any later and conditions would have been too dangerous.

Ambulances transported the babies to the bigger hospital—which has 10 floors, while the women’s hospital only houses patients on one floor, Alford said.

Doctors, residents, the sheriff’s department and others helped transport the precious cargo and all of the equipment needed to keep the babies safe, like respirators and incubators.

“We had 19 NICU babies with four on ventilators, some of them very sick, and we were out in 2 hours,” Alford said. “I have never seen something work so quick and so smooth for something that was unexpected.”

And the journey isn’t over for these little patients. The babies will be transferred to other hospitals around the state, because Lake Charles’ water service was mostly knocked out by the storm.

“This morning because the babies were stable, I got a couple of hours of sleep—we are still in the hospital,” Dr. Bossano said in between coordinating the babies’ next moves.

“It’s a bright spot in this horrific tragedy our community is facing,” Felder said in response to a chorus of cheers celebrating the first patient transfer.</p>
